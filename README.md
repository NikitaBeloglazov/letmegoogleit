# 🔎 letmegoogleit
An improved fork of https://github.com/vkruglikov/google-poisk-vmesto-tebya

This is a simple site for generating "Let me Google that for you" links - a polite way to suggest someone search for information themselves.

## ❓ What is it?

**letmegoogleit** creates special links that shows an animation how to search in the internet, and then redirects to actual search results. It's an educational tool that helps ~~monkeys~~ people learn independent research skills.

## ✏️ Usage

1. Go to https://nikitabeloglazov.github.io/letmegoogleit/
2. Enter the search query need to your friend
3. Click Create link
4. Click Copy link
5. Send to friend
6. Profit! 🎉

A link can also be generated manually, for bots as example
```url
https://nikitabeloglazov.github.io/letmegoogleit?q=encoded_html_string
```

## 😎 Features

- 🎯 Simple link generation
- 📱 Works on all devices
- ⚡ Fast and easy
- 🦧 Clever demonstration that even an monkey can handle
- 🤙 No worries that the domain will expire, be unavailable, show ads or will redirect to something other than Google. Because this is a github page lol

## 💔 Anti-features

- Currently only russian :(. Making an English site is not in the plans, but if you make an issue and even suggest a simple tool for this, I will do it :)

## Installation / Self-host

I really need to write this down? It's just html files.

If you want to self-host this, then place it on any file server: nginx, apache, flask, django, etc.

Please remember that the modification must be open source due to GPLv3 license
